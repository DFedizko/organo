## About

Organo is a web application built to simplify team management by allowing users to easily add and view information about their team members.

The idea originated from the need for a tool that centralizes essential data such as name, role, and profile pictures, enhancing organization and collaboration within teams.

Developed with React, Organo leverages the framework's reactivity and modularity to provide a seamless and responsive user experience. The application is deployed on Vercel, making it accessible to anyone who wants to use it.

This project serves as an excellent opportunity to practice front-end development skills and is a practical example of building an application from scratch, from concept to deployment.
